# HeartBeat Buddy

The Heart Beat Buddy is a heart rate and stress monitor personalised for a specific patient, Michelle. 
Michelle suffers from 'silent' myocardial infarction localised to the inferior aspect of the left ventricular. A contributing factor that can worsen her condition is her highly stressful work environment. 

## Solution

The Heart Beat Buddy is a product designed to suit Michelle's needs. It will monitor her environment and her heart rate to determine if she has high stress levels, which may put her at risk of a heart attack. The product is a lanyard that Michelle will wear daily, personalised to suit her work attire and is user friendly. 
Contained in the casing of the product, is a GSR sensor to detect Michelle's stress levels, a loudness sensor to detect the loudness of her environment and wired around the lanyard is an ear clip heart rate monitor. 
Located on the front of the casing, is an OLED screen which will output information gathered from the sensors. A buzzer will be loacted on the side of the casing, that would buzz to warn Michelle when she is in a highly stressful environment. The buzzer will be activated in an extreme situation where Michelle would be at a very high risk of a heart attack depending on the readings from each sensor.
